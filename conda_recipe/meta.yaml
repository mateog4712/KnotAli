  summary: "RNA secondary structure prediction with pseudoknots using relaxed Hierarchical Folding."
  description: |
    KnotAli is a computational tool for predicting RNA secondary structures, 
    including pseudoknotted configurations, using a relaxed Hierarchical Folding 
    approach. It is designed to analyze RNA alignments in FASTA and CLUSTAL formats 
    and predict optimal secondary structures using a Minimum Free Energy (MFE) model.

    The software is implemented in C++ and requires a C++11-compatible compiler, 
    Pthreads, and CMake (â‰¥3.1) for installation. It is compatible with Linux and macOS, 
    offering a command-line interface for flexible and efficient RNA structure predictions.

    ### Features:
    - Predicts RNA secondary structures, including pseudoknots.
    - Supports multiple sequence alignment input in FASTA and CLUSTAL formats.
    - Uses an MFE-based algorithm for structure optimization.
    - Allows user-defined input constraints for improved accuracy.
