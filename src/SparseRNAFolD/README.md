# SparseRNAFolD

#### Description:
Software implementation of SparseRNAFolD.      
SparseRNAFolD is an algorithm for predicting the pseudoknotted secondary structure of RNA using relaxed Hierarchical Folding.

#### Supported OS: 
Linux, macOS


### Installation:  
Requirements: A compiler that supports C++17 standard (tested with g++ version 4.9.0 or higher), Pthreads, and CMake version 3.8 or greater.    

[CMake](https://cmake.org/install/) version 3.8 or greater must be installed in a way that SparseRNAFolD can find it.    
To test if your Mac or Linux system already has CMake, you can type into a terminal:      
```
cmake --version
```
If it does not print a cmake version greater than or equal to 3.8, you will have to install CMake depending on your operating system.

#### Steps for installation   
1. [Download the repository](https://github.com/mateog4712/SparseRNAFolD.git) and extract the files onto your system.
2. From a command line in the root directory (where this README.md is) run
```
cmake -H. -Bbuild
cmake --build build
```   
If you need to specify a specific compiler, such as g++, you can instead run something like   
```
cmake -H. -Bbuild -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++
cmake --build build
```   
This can be useful if you are getting errors about your compiler not having C++11 features.

After installing you can move the executables wherever you wish, but you should not delete or move the simfold folder, or you must recompile the executables. If you move the folders and wish to recompile, you should first delete the created "build" folder before recompiling.

Help
========================================

```
Usage: SparseRNAFolD[options] [input sequence]
```

Read input file from cmdline; predict minimum free energy and optimum structure using the time- and space-efficient MFE RNA folding algorithm.

```
  -h, --help             Print help and exit
  -V, --version          Print version and exit
  -v, --verbose          Turn on verbose output
  -m, --mark-candidates  Represent candidate base pairs by square brackets
  -r, --input-structure  Give a restricted structure as an input structure
  -d, --dangles=INT      How to treat \"dangling end\" energies for bases adjacent to helices in free ends and multi-loops (default=`2')
  -P, --paramFile        Read energy parameters from paramfile, instead of using the default parameter set.
  --noGC                 Turn off garbage collection and related overhead
```

#### Example:
    assume you are in the KnotAli directory
    ./build/src/SparseRNAFolD GGGGAAAACCCC
    ./build/src/SparseRNAFolD GGGGAAAACCCC -r "((........))" -d1

```
./build/src/SparseRNAFolD -m -v UAACUUAGGGGUUAAAGUUGCAGAUUGUGGCUCUGAAAACACGGGUUCGAA
